A <a href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/presentation/Scene\">Scene<\/a> interface represents a screen and\ncan be regarded as a basic building block for the application flow.\n<a href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/navigation/Navigator\">Navigators<\/a> control this application flow, and can\nbe composed together to form a large structure.\nFinally, <a href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/presentation/Container\">Containers<\/a> form the boundary between your\npresentation layer and the UI elements.<\/p>\n<p class=\"image-preview\"><img src=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/media/acorn_diagram.svg\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n<p>On top of this, Acorn provides an extensive set of default implementations to\ndo the work for you: several base Scene implementations that provide the basics,\nand a couple of Navigators that can be composed together to create the\nnavigational structure that you need.<\/p>\n<p>Acorn decouples the UI from navigation, meaning the user interface becomes a\nplugin into the navigational state.\nThis gives you full control over your view elements and especially your\ntransition animations.<\/p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/wiki\">Wiki<\/a> section you can find information on several topics\nwhen working with Acorn.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note: this documentation website is work in progress, and some sections may be\nmissing or incomplete.<\/em><\/p>\n"
